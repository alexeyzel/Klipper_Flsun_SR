# Klipper Flsun SR

This is my Klipper configuration for the Flsun SR. My Flsun SR is not stock; it has the following modifications:
- Built-in Raspberry Pi 3 running Klipper, with a BIGTREETECH PI TFT43 screen mounted on a custom-made bracket
- Direct-drive extruder using a Bondtech LGX® Lite (custom-made mount)
- Trianglelab 115W High Power CHC Pro PT1000 hotend
- Trianglelab TUN Pro nozzle with the corresponding Trianglelab heatsink (the heatsink had to be cut to fit the stock mounting plate)
- Noctua fan for the extruder heatsink
- LED lights driven by a Wemos D1 Mini board with ESPHome (Home Assistant), installed in two towers
- 5MP USB webcam
- Mean Well LRS-350-24 PSU (quieter)
